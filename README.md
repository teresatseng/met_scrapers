# Webscrapers for the Met Museum
The Met has graciously made [select datasets](https://metmuseum.github.io/) public through their API.  When searching the [collection](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?q=) on the website, we realized that some useful data was missing from the API. These scripts (Python3, BeautifulSoup) are quick and dirty solutions for scraping the collection website.

### Installing
Download script, run 'chmod +x scriptname.py' to make it executable

### Running
Run './scriptname.py', no command line arguments required (may change)
